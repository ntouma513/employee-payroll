# employee-payroll

## overview
This challenge allows a payroll manager to add and display their employee's payroll data in a table. They would also be able to display the average salary via an alert or in the console and review a random employee via an alert or the console. I chose to only include a console log for both average salary and random employee seleciton but researching the different resources and trying different codes was really interesting and fun to see how different codes can display different wants. 

## challenges
Learning how to utilize the many different statements within Javascript was very difficult. There was a lot of references to the activities and a lot of saving, finding errors, and debugging those errors in relation to how I was using operators, variables, objects, functions, and number methods.
